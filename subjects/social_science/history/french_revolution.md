## Reasons for an empty treasury.

The ruler who was in the throne, when the political revolution started, was
King Louis XVI. He was throned in 1774. Which was also a bad time for France.
The treasury of France was empty. This was because of three very main reasons:

1. France had been in battle with Britain for a while now, and the ammunition,
   and the armies had cost a great deal.

2. Money was spent extravagantly on maintaining magnificient monuments like
   the _Versailles_. 

3. When Louis was throned, the 13 American colonies were suffering a great
   deal from tthe invading of Britain. Since France and America shared a
   common enemy, Britain, Louis decided that he must help America, without
   giving a thought that their own treasury was out of money. The war further
   more drained France of its money.

And so, Louis was in a fix. To meet the country's regular expenses, he had to
increase taxes. But even this measure did not suffice.

## Types of taxes the church laid on the people.

The church, too, collected its share of taxes from the people:

* _Tithes_ : This was a tax which was to be paid by only the pesants.
* _Tailles_ : This was a tax which was to be paid by all members of third
  estate.
