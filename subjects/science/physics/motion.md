## What is motion?
When an object moves from one place to another, it is referred to as motion.

## Types of Motion
The types of motion are :

* Linear motion - That is, when an object moves straight continuously.

* Non-linear motion - That is, when an object _does not_ move straight
  continuosly.

* Uniform motion - When an object moves equal distances at equal intervals of
  time, it is known as Uniform Motion.

* Non-Uniform Motion - When an object moves equal distances at unequal
  intervals of time, or when it moves unequal distances in qual intervals of
  time, it is known as Non-uniform motion.
