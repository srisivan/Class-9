# Chapter 1 - Tissues

## What is meant by the term _'tissues'_?

From the previous classes, we have learnt that living organisms are made up
odf fundamental units of life, called _cells)_. Now, there are two types of
organisms. They are:

* Unicellular Organisms
* Multicellular Organisms

### Unicellular Organisms
The word 'unicellular' is made up of two words: 'uni' means 'single', and the
word 'cell'. Hence, unicellular means 'an organism with a single cell'.

Unicellular organisms can funcion on their own with a single cell. The process
of excretion, intake, digestion, and respiration all is done by a single cell. 

Some examples of unicellular organisms include: Amoeba, Paramecium, etc.

### Multicellular Organisms
Multicellular is self explanatory. It is an organism, which contains multiple
cells. Now, by multiple cells, I do not mean just a few cells.
